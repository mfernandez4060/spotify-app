# Spotiapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `https://spotify-service-ui.herokuapp.com`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This application is a test to demonstrate my ability in software development. I will constantly work on this application to increase its functionality.

This application works with a backend layer developed in Java 8, built with TDD methodology
